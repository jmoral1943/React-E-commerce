# ArcSurf React E-commerce website
Arcsurf is the name of a fictional surf shop and I made a react e-commerce website that uses a Node.js backend with a React.js frontend. That fetches data from a MySQL database. 

To start the project you...
```
git clone https://github.com/jmoral1943/React-E-commerce
cd React-E-commerce 
npm i
npm run install
npm run start
```

The client is using a create-react-app that is proxying to the node server for the api endpoints that I need to serve up the database information.
